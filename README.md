HTTP Server - Java.

HTTP server that serves "index.html" when accessed via the root path ("/"). Ensure that the "index.html" file is in the same directory as your Java file or update the file path accordingly.

For other paths, it responds with a 404 error. You can modify the MyHandler class to handle different types of requests or serve additional files as needed.

To use it on port 80 , grant root access.


Remember, when developing real applications, you should handle exceptions, manage resources properly, and consider security aspects like input validation and error handling. Additionally, 
for more complex applications, using frameworks like Spring Boot or Jetty might provide more features and easier management of HTTP endpoints.
